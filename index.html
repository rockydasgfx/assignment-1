            This app utilizes Bluetooth signal to understand if you are near
            another Tracer app user. It will help you in identifying whether you
            are at risk of COVID-19 infection, by checking if you have been in
            recent contact with an infected individual. If your case seems
            risky, you will be able to seek medical help at the earliest and go
            into self-isolation.
